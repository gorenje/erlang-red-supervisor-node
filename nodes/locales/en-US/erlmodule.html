Node for encapsulating Erlang modules.

Modules in Erlang are a collection of functions that can be collectively instantiated using the module. However modules are not to be confused with objects as modules have no internal state nor data.

Modules are better thought of encapsulating common functionality under the banner of a single name.

### Inputs

None.

### Outputs

None.

### Details

Module nodes provide the means to store Erlang module code in flows. Modules are used for provide the behaviours for the Generic Server, Statemachine and Event handler nodes. For each of these behaviours, module nodes have boilerplate template code to provide a starting point.

Module nodes can also provide helper code for the function nodes that make use of them.

Module nodes are always initialised and installed before other nodes. So they are guaranteed to be available to other nodes when flow execution begins.

Modules are installed in the Eshell that, for example, the docker image drops into. Modules are therefore also accessible within the Erlang process running Erlang-Red.
